<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Network models are an essential block of modern networks. For example, they are widely used in network planning and optimization. However, as networks increase in scale and complexity, some models presents limitations, such as the assumption of Markovian traffic in queueing theory models, or the high computational cost of network simulators. Recent advances in machine learning, such as Graph Neural Networks(GNN), are enabling a new generation of network models that are data-driven and can learn complex non-linear behaviours. In this paper, we present RouteNet-Fermi, a custom GNN model that shares the same goal as queuing theory, while being considerably more accurate in the presence of realistic traffic models. The proposed model predicts accurately the delay, jitter, and packet loss of a network. We have tested RouteNet-Fermi in networks of increasing size (up yo 300 nodes), including samples with mixed traffic profiles - e.g., with complex non-Markovian models - and arbitrary routing and queue scheduling configurations. Our experimental results show that RouteNet-Fermi achieves similar accuracy as computationally-expensive packet-level simulators and scales accurately to larger networks. Our model produces delay estimates with a mean relative error of 6.24% when applied to a test dataset of 1,000 examples, including network topologies one order of magnitude larger than those seen during training. Finally, we have also evaluated RouteNet-Fermi with measurements from a physical testbed and packet traces from a real-life network.</p>
<p><strong>Index terms:</strong> Network Modeling, Graph Neural Networks, Queuing Theory</p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Network modeling is arguably one of the key tools when designing, building, and evaluating computer networks, even since the early days of networking. Network models are used in protocol design, performance evaluation, or network planning, just to cite a few examples. The wo most widespread network modeling techniques are analytical models based on Queuing Theory (QT), and packet-level simulators.</p>
<p>However, the evolution of computer networks especially concerning complexity traffic characteristics, highlights some of the limitations of classical modeling techniques. Despite the tremendous success and widespread usage, some scenarios require more advanced techniques capable of accurately modeling complex traffic characteristics, while scaling to large real-world networks.</p>
<p>Especially, two relevant applications can benefit from advanced network modeling techniques: Network Digital Twins (NDT), and the network optimization tools. Commonly, an NDT is referred to as a virtual replica of a physical network that can accurately mimic its behavior and can make performance predictions for any given input condition (e.g., traffic, topology change, or new routing configuration). In other words, an NDT is an accurate network model that can support a wide range of network configurations and that can accurately model the complex non-linear behaviors behind real-world networks. As a result, NDTs can be used to produce accurate performance predictions, carry out what-if analysis, or perform network optimization by pairing it with an optimization algorithm.</p>
<p>In the context of network optimization, we can only optimize what we can model. Optimization algorithm operate by searching the network configuration space (e.g., to find an alternative routing scheme). For each configuration, a network model is used to estimate the resulting performance to see if it fulfills the optimization goal (e.g., minimize delay). To achieve efficient online optimization, it is essential to have an accurate and fast network model.</p>
<p>State-of-the-art modeling techniques have important limitations in effectively supporting the stringent requirements of current packet-switched networks. Queuing Theory imposes strong assumptions on the packet arrival process (Poisson traffic generation), which often is not sufficient to model real-world networks. Internet traffic has been extensively analyzed in the past two decades, and despite the community has not agreed on universal model, there is consensus that in general aggregated traffic shows strong auto-correlation and a heavy-tail.</p>
<p>Alternatively, packet-level simulators can accurately model networks. However, this comes at a high computational cost. The cost of a simulator depends linearly on the number of packets forwarded, which can be in the range of millions per second on a single 1Gbps link. In consequence, they are slow and impractical when considering large networks with realistic traffic volumes. This also severely limits its applicability to online network optimization, given the hard time constraints of such type of applications.</p>
<p>In this context, Deep Learning (DL) offers an extraordinary set of techniques to build accurate data-driven network models. DL models cam be trained with real data, without making any assumptions about physical networks. This enables building models with unprecedented accuracy by modeling the entire range of non-linear and multidimensional characteristics.</p>
<p>In this paper, we first make a systematic analysis of the performance of DL techniques for network modeling, using classical discrete-event network simulators as baseline. Specifically, we analyse the performance of Multilayer Perceptron-based (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network-based (RNN), and Graph Neural Network-based (GNN) models. We find that classical DL techniques, such as MLPs and RNNs are not practical enough for network modeling as they fail to provide accurate estimates when the network scenario differs from the examples seen during training (e.g., link failure). More recently, GNNs have been proposed as a novel neural network architecture specifically designed to learn over graph-structured data. They have been successfully used in other domains, such as quantum chemistry or logistics. However, in our analysis, we find that standard GNNs do not work well for network modeling and that we need a custom GNN architecture to model computer networks.</p>
<p>As a result, we propose RouteNet-Fermi (RouteNet-F), a GNN architecture for network modeling. RouteNet-F shares the same goals as Queuing Theory. It provides performance estimates (delay, jitter, and packet-loss) on given network scenarios (Figure 1) with remarkable accuracy and speed. The proposed model is not limited to Markovian traffic as Queuing Theory; it supports arbitrary models (including auto-correlated processes) which better represent the properties of real-world traffic. Interestingly, it also overcomes one of the main limitations of DL-based models: RouteNet-F generalises and provides accurate estimates in network scenarios not seen in training (e.g., different topologies, traffic metrics, routing configurations). We benchmark RouteNet-F against a state-of-the-art DL-based model (MimicNet) and with a state-of-the-art queuing theory model. We show that our model outperforms both baselines in all scenarios, achieving a 5.64% error when tested in a dataset with packet traces coming from a real-world network, an 11% error when evaluated in a physical testbed, and a 6.24% error when estimating the delay on networks over a large dataset with 1,000 network examples, with topologies ranging from 50 to 300 nodes.</p>
<p><img src="/2024/03/14/RouteNet-Fermi/Fig_1.png" alt="Black-box representation of RouteNet-F"></p>
<p>As any Deep Learning model, RouteNet-Fermi does not provide strong mathematical performance guarantees. However, the error of the estimates produced by the model is strongly bounded. The minimum estimated delay assumes no queuing across the path while the maximum assumes that all the queues are full. RouteNet-Fermi will not produce delay estimates outside these bounds.</p>

<h2 id="Challenges-of-Data-Driven-Network-Modeling"><a href="#Challenges-of-Data-Driven-Network-Modeling" class="headerlink" title="Challenges of Data-Driven Network Modeling"></a>Challenges of Data-Driven Network Modeling</h2><p>This section describes the main challenges that data-driven solutions need to address for network modeling. These challenges drove the core design of RouteNet-Fermi.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Models:</strong> Networks carry different types of traffic, so, supporting arbitrary stochastic traffic model is crucial. Experimental observations show that traffic on the Internet has strong auto-correlation and heavy-tails. In this context, it is well-known that main limitation of Queuing Theory is that it fails to provide accurate estimates on realistic Markovian models with continuous state space, or non-Markovian traffic models. The challenge for DL-based modeling is: How can we design a neural network architecture that can accurately model realistic traffic models.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Generalisation:</strong> One of the main differences between analytical modeling (e.g., QT) and data-driven modeling is that the latter requires training. In DL, training involves obtaining a representative dataset of network measurements. The dataset needs to include a broad spectrum of network operational regimes, ranging from different congestion levels to various routing configurations, among others. In other words, the DL model cam predict only scenarios it has previously seen. Note that this is a common property of all neural network architectures.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would obtain this training dataset from a production network, since they commonly have systems in place to measure performance. However, it would be difficult to obtain a representative dataset. As we mentioned previously, we would need to measure the production network when it is experiencing extreme performance degradation as the result of link failures, incorrect configurations, severe congestion, etc. However, these situations are not common in production networks, which limits the ability to generate the training dataset. A reasonable alternative is creating these datasets in controlled testbeds, where it is possible to use different traffic models, implement a broad set of configurations, and replicate a wide range of network failures. Thus, the DL model can be trained on samples from testbed and then, applied to production networks. Hence, the research challenge is: how to design a DL model that can provide accurate estimates in network not seen during training? This incudes topologies, traffic, and configurations (e.g., queuing scheduling, routing) different from those seen in the training network testbed.</p>
<p>Leveraging a testbed that is smaller than a production network creates another challenge: the generalisation to larger networks. Real-world networks include hundreds or thousands of nodes, and building a network testbed at this scale is typically unfeasible. As a result, the Dl model should be able to learn from datasets with samples of small network testbeds and predict metrics for considerably larger networks, e.g., by a factor of 10-100x. Generalising to larger networks, or graphs in general, is currently an open research challenge in the field of GNNs.</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Service and Scheduling Policies:</strong> A key requirement of modern networks is supporting Quality of Service (QoS), usually implemented via scheduling policies and mapping of traffic flows to QoS classes. Hence, a DL model should be able to predict the performance of the input traffic flows with their associated QoS class, similarly to how QT models support a wide range of scheduling policies.</p>
<h2 id="Limitations-of-Current-Network-Modeling-Techniques"><a href="#Limitations-of-Current-Network-Modeling-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of Current Network Modeling Techniques"></a>Limitations of Current Network Modeling Techniques</h2><p>This section explores the performance of different DL models with respect to an accurate packet-level simulator and discusses the main limitations of existing network modeling techniques.</p>
<h3 id="A-Simulations-as-Network-Modeling-Technique"><a href="#A-Simulations-as-Network-Modeling-Technique" class="headerlink" title="A. Simulations as Network Modeling Technique"></a>A. Simulations as Network Modeling Technique</h3><p>Network simulators reproduce the network behaviour at the granularity of packet events. This way, they can offer excellent accuracy and can be easily extended to include virtually and feature, such as packet scheduling, wireless networks, etc. Some simulators, such as Omnet++ or ns-3, are widely used and maintained.</p>
<p>However, their main limitation is the simulation time, especially for networks with high-speed links (10Gbps and above). Hence, depending on the amount of the traffic found in the target network, it may become unfeasible to simulate the network.</p>
<p>To illustrate this limitation, we simulate different topologies using the Omnet++ simulator to calculate the delay of a set of source-destination flows (CPU Intel Xeon Silver 4210R @2.40GHz). Network topologies are artificially generated using the Power-Law Out-Degree Algorithm from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/892042">this paper</a> and a traffic distribution that follows a Poisson process.</p>
<p>Figure shows the simulation time of such networks depending on the number of events. Here, an event refers to a transition in status of the network (e.g., adding a new packet to queue). We can see that the simulation time increases linearly and that simulating 4 billion events may appear a larger figure, consider that a 10Gbps link transmitting regular Ethernet frames translates to <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: -0.05ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="6.961ex" height="1.62ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -694 3076.8 716"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mo"><path data-c="2248" d="M55 319Q55 360 72 393T114 444T163 472T205 482Q207 482 213 482T223 483Q262 483 296 468T393 413L443 381Q502 346 553 346Q609 346 649 375T694 454Q694 465 698 474T708 483Q722 483 722 452Q722 386 675 338T555 289Q514 289 468 310T388 357T308 404T224 426Q164 426 125 393T83 318Q81 289 69 289Q55 289 55 319ZM55 85Q55 126 72 159T114 210T163 238T205 248Q207 248 213 248T223 249Q262 249 296 234T393 179L443 147Q502 112 553 112Q609 112 649 141T694 220Q694 249 708 249T722 217Q722 153 675 104T555 55Q514 55 468 76T388 123T308 170T224 192Q164 192 125 159T83 84Q80 55 69 55Q55 55 55 85Z"></path></g><g data-mml-node="mn" transform="translate(1055.8,0)"><path data-c="38" d="M70 417T70 494T124 618T248 666Q319 666 374 624T429 515Q429 485 418 459T392 417T361 389T335 371T324 363L338 354Q352 344 366 334T382 323Q457 264 457 174Q457 95 399 37T249 -22Q159 -22 101 29T43 155Q43 263 172 335L154 348Q133 361 127 368Q70 417 70 494ZM286 386L292 390Q298 394 301 396T311 403T323 413T334 425T345 438T355 454T364 471T369 491T371 513Q371 556 342 586T275 624Q268 625 242 625Q201 625 165 599T128 534Q128 511 141 492T167 463T217 431Q224 426 228 424L286 386ZM250 21Q308 21 350 55T392 137Q392 154 387 169T375 194T353 216T330 234T301 253T274 270Q260 279 244 289T218 306L210 311Q204 311 181 294T133 239T107 157Q107 98 150 60T250 21Z"></path><path data-c="32" d="M109 429Q82 429 66 447T50 491Q50 562 103 614T235 666Q326 666 387 610T449 465Q449 422 429 383T381 315T301 241Q265 210 201 149L142 93L218 92Q375 92 385 97Q392 99 409 186V189H449V186Q448 183 436 95T421 3V0H50V19V31Q50 38 56 46T86 81Q115 113 136 137Q145 147 170 174T204 211T233 244T261 278T284 308T305 340T320 369T333 401T340 431T343 464Q343 527 309 573T212 619Q179 619 154 602T119 569T109 550Q109 549 114 549Q132 549 151 535T170 489Q170 464 154 447T109 429Z" transform="translate(500,0)"></path><path data-c="30" d="M96 585Q152 666 249 666Q297 666 345 640T423 548Q460 465 460 320Q460 165 417 83Q397 41 362 16T301 -15T250 -22Q224 -22 198 -16T137 16T82 83Q39 165 39 320Q39 494 96 585ZM321 597Q291 629 250 629Q208 629 178 597Q153 571 145 525T137 333Q137 175 145 125T181 46Q209 16 250 16Q290 16 318 46Q347 76 354 130T362 333Q362 478 354 524T321 597Z" transform="translate(1000,0)"></path></g><g data-mml-node="mi" transform="translate(2555.8,0)"><path data-c="1D458" d="M121 647Q121 657 125 670T137 683Q138 683 209 688T282 694Q294 694 294 686Q294 679 244 477Q194 279 194 272Q213 282 223 291Q247 309 292 354T362 415Q402 442 438 442Q468 442 485 423T503 369Q503 344 496 327T477 302T456 291T438 288Q418 288 406 299T394 328Q394 353 410 369T442 390L458 393Q446 405 434 405H430Q398 402 367 380T294 316T228 255Q230 254 243 252T267 246T293 238T320 224T342 206T359 180T365 147Q365 130 360 106T354 66Q354 26 381 26Q429 26 459 145Q461 153 479 153H483Q499 153 499 144Q499 139 496 130Q455 -11 378 -11Q333 -11 305 15T277 90Q277 108 280 121T283 145Q283 167 269 183T234 206T200 217T182 220H180Q168 178 159 139T145 81T136 44T129 20T122 7T111 -2Q98 -11 83 -11Q66 -11 57 -1T48 16Q48 26 85 176T158 471L195 616Q196 629 188 632T149 637H144Q134 637 131 637T124 640T121 647Z"></path></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> events per seconds or 247 million events in 5 minutes of network activity for a single link. For example, in our experiments, the simulator takes around 8h to compute the performance metrics of a 300-node network.</p>
<p>So, the main limitation of packet-level simulators is the simulation time. On the contrary, packet simulators offer unrivalled accuracy and can simulate virtually any scenario, from different routing configurations to replaying packet traces to simulate unknown traffic models. Because of this, hereafter, we consider the results from the simulator as the ground truth for the evaluations in this paper.</p>

Neural Networks as Network Modeling Techniques"></a>B. Neural Networks as Network Modeling Techniques</h3><p>The following sections review the performance of three common Neural Network (NN) architectures in the order of increasing complexity. First, we evaluate the Multilayer Perceptron, one of the simplest NNs. Next, Recurrent Neural Networks which are designed to work with sequences. Finally, we directly input the network into a Graph Neural Network specifically designed to work with graphs. The objective is to create a network model with the NN that can predict performance parameters for input networks with a wide range of characteristics. We are especially interested in the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> How close is the prediction to simulation values?</li>
<li><strong>Different Routing:</strong> Does the accuracy degrade if we change the routing configuration?</li>
<li><strong>Link Failures:</strong> Quantify if link failures affect the quality of predictions?</li>
</ul>
<p>We trained and test the three neural networks with the same dataset, obtained from simulations with Omnet++. The input values are the network characteristics (topology, routing configuration, traffic model and intensity, etc), and the output values are the delay for each path. Hence, all the errors are computed with respect to values of the simulator. We use four different datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traffic Models:</strong> In it, we consider traffic models that are non-Poisson, auto-correlated, and with heavy tails. Table IV details the different traffic models.</li>
<li><strong>Same Routing:</strong> Where the testing and training datasets contain networks with the same routing configurations.</li>
<li><strong>Different Routing:</strong> Where the training and testing datasets contain networks with different routing configurations.</li>
<li><strong>Link failures:</strong> Here, we iteratively remove one link of the topology to replicate a link failure, until we transform the network graph into a connected acyclic graph. This scenario is the most complex since a link failure triggers a change both in the routing and the topology.</li>
</ul>
<p>To compare the different techniques, we compute the prediction error with respect to the accurate performance values produced by the simulator. Particularly we use the following error metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE),</li>
<li>Mean Squared Error (MSE),</li>
<li>Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and</li>

<h3 id="C-Multilayer-Perceptron"><a href="#C-Multilayer-Perceptron" class="headerlink" title="C. Multilayer Perceptron"></a>C. Multilayer Perceptron</h3><p>A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a basic kind of NN from the family of feedforward NNs. In short, input data is propagated unidirectionally from the input neuron layer to the output layer. There may be an arbitrary number of hidden layers between these two layers, and this determines how deep is the NN.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design:</strong> Several works have leveraged an MLP to predict network performance metrics. Based on this work, we have built an MLP to predict the mean delay for each source-destination pair of nodes of a given network. The MLP has 8,280 inputs and two hidden layers with 4096 neurons and uses Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) as activation functions.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Table I presents the error when predicting the network delay with respect to the results produced by the network simulator, including several traffic models. We can see that the MLP offers good accuracy for Poisson traffic, but the error increases significantly for the rest of the traffic models showing a MAPE between 23% and 84%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, Table II shows the error of predicting the delay for the datasets with the same/different routing and link failures. We can see that the MLP cannot offer an accurate estimate when predicting the delay of a previously unseen routing configuration (1150% of error). This is due to the internal architecture of the MLP. During training, the MLP performs overfitting, meaning that the model only learns about the initial network topology used for training and not for any others. When we input a new topology, it does not have sufficient information to make an accurate prediction.</p>
<h3 id="D-Recurrent-Neural-Networks"><a href="#D-Recurrent-Neural-Networks" class="headerlink" title="D. Recurrent Neural Networks"></a>D. Recurrent Neural Networks</h3><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a more advanced type of NN. They have shown excellent performance when processing sequential data. This is mainly because they connect some layers to the previous ones, which gives them the ability to keep the state along sequences.  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design:</strong> Several works propose RNNs as a way to predict network performance. In this experiment, we build a sequential model with an RNN (Figure 4). Particularly, we choose a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We initialise the state of each path with the sequence of nodes in the path and the features of the traffic model (e.g., packets, bandwidth, <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: -0.027ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.319ex" height="1.597ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -694 583 706"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mi"><path data-c="1D706" d="M166 673Q166 685 183 694H202Q292 691 316 644Q322 629 373 486T474 207T524 67Q531 47 537 34T546 15T551 6T555 2T556 -2T550 -11H482Q457 3 450 18T399 152L354 277L340 262Q327 246 293 207T236 141Q211 112 174 69Q123 9 111 -1T83 -12Q47 -12 47 20Q47 37 61 52T199 187Q229 216 266 252T321 306L338 322Q338 323 288 462T234 612Q214 657 183 657Q166 657 166 673Z"></path></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container>, <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: -0.025ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="0.919ex" height="1ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -431 406 442"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mi"><path data-c="1D716" d="M227 -11Q149 -11 95 41T40 174Q40 262 87 322Q121 367 173 396T287 430Q289 431 329 431H367Q382 426 382 411Q382 385 341 385H325H312Q191 385 154 277L150 265H327Q340 256 340 246Q340 228 320 219H138V217Q128 187 128 143Q128 77 160 52T231 26Q258 26 284 36T326 57T343 68Q350 68 354 58T358 39Q358 36 357 35Q354 31 337 21T289 0T227 -11Z"></path></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container>, <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: -0.025ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.448ex" height="1.025ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -442 640 453"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mi"><path data-c="1D6FC" d="M34 156Q34 270 120 356T309 442Q379 442 421 402T478 304Q484 275 485 237V208Q534 282 560 374Q564 388 566 390T582 393Q603 393 603 385Q603 376 594 346T558 261T497 161L486 147L487 123Q489 67 495 47T514 26Q528 28 540 37T557 60Q559 67 562 68T577 70Q597 70 597 62Q597 56 591 43Q579 19 556 5T512 -10H505Q438 -10 414 62L411 69L400 61Q390 53 370 41T325 18T267 -2T203 -11Q124 -11 79 39T34 156ZM208 26Q257 26 306 47T379 90L403 112Q401 255 396 290Q382 405 304 405Q235 405 183 332Q156 292 139 224T121 120Q121 71 146 49T208 26Z"></path></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container>, or on-off time), and we update the state of each link across the path.

Once the path state has been computed, an MLP with 2 hidden layers computes the final output.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> We train the RNN with the same datasets as the previous subsection. Although the RNN supports better different traffic models than the MLP (Table I), it still struggles to produce accurate predictions when there are routing or topology changes (Table II), especially for different routing configurations (30% error), or when removing links (63%).</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason behind the lack of capability of RNNs to understand routing changes and link failures is due to its internal architecture. RNNs can accommodate different end-to-end paths in the network (i.e., series of routers and links), thereby, making it easier to perform predictions for paths never seen in the training phase. However, this structure cannot store and update the status of individual links in the topology due to the inter-dependency between links and traffic flows (i.e., routing). In other words, if the status of a link changes, it affects several flows, and vice-versa. This generates circular dependencies that RNNs are not able to model (see more details in Sec. IV).</p>
<h3 id="Graph-Neural-Networks"><a href="#Graph-Neural-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Graph Neural Networks"></a>Graph Neural Networks</h3><p>Networks are fundamentally represented as graphs, where networking devices are the graph nodes and the links connecting devices are the graph edges. This interconnection translates to the fact that the <strong>different elements in the network are dependent on each other</strong>. Since most standard DL models (e.g., MLP, RNN) assume independent flow-level data points. This renders them inaccurate for our use case. Hence, a model that is capable of processing directly the network graph is arguably more desirable for network modeling, because <strong>it will be able, not only to obtain information from the individual nodes and edges but also from the underlying data structure</strong> (i.e., the relationships between the different elements).</p>
<p>GNNs are a type of neural network designed to work with graph-structured data. They have two key characteristics that make them a good candidate for a network model. First, GNNs have the ability to store node-level hidden states and update them in each iteration. Second, they process the input data directly as a graph, both during training and inference. This means that the internal structure of the neural network depends on the input graph. Hence, they can dynamically adapt to the underlying dependencies between the different elements of a network. The latter is of special importance, since changes in the network graph (e.g., routing modifications, link failures) are the main limitation of other DL-based models, such as MLPs and RNNs, as we have seen in the previous subsections.</p>
<p>In this section, we build a standard GNN model to predict the mean per-flow delay in networks.</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> We implement a Message-Passing Neural Network (MPNN), a powerful state-of-the-art GNN architecture that can efficiently capture dependencies between the elements of input graphs.

The readout function is implemented with a two-layer fully connected NN with ReLUs as activation functions for the hidden layers and a linear activation for the output layer.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> We evaluate the accuracy of the MPNN model when predicting the mean flow-level delay, as in previous subsections. Table III presents the delay prediction errors in the same scenarios of the previous experiments: routing configurations, both seen and not seen during training, and link failures. Unfortunately, the results are similar to those of the RNN: the routing configurations from the training dataset are easy to predict, with an error as low as 3%, while new routing configurations and link failures increase the error significantly (respectively, 50% and 125% of MAPE), thus showing even larger errors than the RNN model.  </p>
<p>The main reason behind the poor accuracy of the MPNN model is that the architecture of this model is directly built based on the network topology without taking into account the paths traversed by different traffic flows (i.e., the routing configuration), which is a fundamental property to understand inter-dependencies between flows and links. More specifically, when we test the model with the same routing configuration, it learns the relationships between flows and links. However, when we change this configuration, those previously-learned relationships are no longer valid, and the model is not able to capture the relationships between elements in the new scenario.</p>
<p>This intuition is better understood with an extreme packet loss example. Let’s suppose we have the sample network in Figure 3.

<p>Knowing this, we can see how there is a circular dependency between the flows and links found in the network. At the same time, the state of a flow depends on the state of the links they traverse, and the state of the links depends on the state of the flows passing through them.</p>
<p>If we apply a standard GNN over this example, the state of each flow is not updated at each hop. Therefore, the GNN does not have a structure that represents how the delay depends on both the links (topology) and the flows that go through each specific router.</p>
<p>Hence, we conclude that feeding the MPNN directly with the network topology graph is not sufficient to accurately perform network modeling. However, more complex and customised GNN-based architectures can still be powerful for modeling the inter-dependencies between the different network elements and generalising over new network scenarios by exploiting the underlying graph structure.</p>
